== Hive samples

There are three sample applications that use Hive. The examples are

* A simple /etc/passwd file analysis application using HiveTemplate via the Thrift API.
* A simple /etc/passwd file analysis application using JDBC
* A more complex Apache Log file analysis example using HiveRunner

=== Building and running

Use the following commands to build and run the sample

    $ mvn clean package
    $ sh ./target/appassembler/bin/hiveApp
    $ sh ./target/appassembler/bin/hiveAppJdbc
    $ sh ./target/appassembler/bin/hiveAppWithApacheLogs
